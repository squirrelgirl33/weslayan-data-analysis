Using the NESARC data set to learn basic data analysis (panda, numpy) in Python

This work relates to the following courses on Coursera:

https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-tools/home/welcome
https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization/home/welcome
(I started the final course on machine learning, but one of the packages had changed so much since the course was written that I couldn't figure out how to get things to work)

While the code contains some information on the questions asked an answered, the "Questions to be answered and notes.txt" goes over the general sections of interest and why. Furthermore, a better explanation of each assignment and the results can be found here:
